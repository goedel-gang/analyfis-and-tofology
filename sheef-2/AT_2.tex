  We work in a complete metric space \((M, d)\).

  Since each of the \(A_n\) is non-empty, and assming we are working in strong
  enough axiomatic foundations, for each \(n\) we can choose an arbitrary
  \(a_n \in A_n\). I claim that \((a_n)\) is Cauchy and
  \(\displaystyle a_n \to a \in \bigcap_{i \in \N}A_i\), so the
  intersection is indeed non-empty.

  Given \(\varepsilon > 0\), since \(\operatorname{diam}(A_n) \to 0\), we have
  some \(N \in \N\) such that for all \(n \geq N\) and \(x, y \in A_n\) we have
  \(d(x, y) \leq \varepsilon\). So given
  \(m, n \in \N\) with \(m, n \geq N\), we have
  \(a_m, a_n \in A_m, A_n \subseteq A_N\) so
  \(d(a_m, a_n) \leq \varepsilon\). Hence \((a_n)\) is Cauchy.

  By the completeness of the metric space we are working in, it must converge,
  say to \(a\). To show this lies in the intersection, it remains to show that
  given
  some \(n \in \N\), \(a \in A_n\). Consider the sequence \(b_i = a_{n + i - 1}\).
  This converges to \(a\) as well, but since it consists of values \(a_m\) with
  \(m \geq n\), all of its points are contained in \(A_n\). This means \((b_i)\)
  is a convergent sequence in the closed set \(A_n\), so its limit point \(a\)
  must be in \(A_n\). So we have \(\forall\ n \in \N, a \in A_n\) which is
  equivalent to \(\displaystyle a \in \bigcap_{i \in \N}A_i\). So the
  intersection is non-empty.

  I will prove that a nested sequence of closed balls in a complete metric space
  has non-empty intersection. Suppose we have our sequence
  \(B_{r_1}(a_1) \supseteq B_{r_2}(a_2) \subseteq \cdots\), where we have the
  sequence \((a_n)\) in \(M\) of centres of the balls and a sequence \((r_n)\) in
  \(\R_{>0}\) of their radii. Since \((r_n)\) is decreasing and bounded below,
  it must converge, say to \(r\). I will prove that \((a_n)\) converges to a
  point in the intersection of all of the balls, by first proving the sequence
  is Cauchy (and then the same argument as above holds).

  Given \(\varepsilon > 0\), since \((r_n)\) convergent in \(\R\) is is also
  Cauchy, so there exists \(N \in \N\) such that for all \(m > n \geq N\) we have
  \(r_m - r_n \leq \varepsilon\).
  Since the balls are nested, we must have for all \(i\)
  \[d(a_i, a_{i+1}) \leq r_i - r_{i+1}\]
  and given \(m, n \geq N\) we can sum this inequality for \(i = m\) up to \(i = n\):
  \[\sum_{i=m}^n d(a_i, a_{i+1}) \leq \sum_{i=m}^n (r_i - r_{i+1})\]
  applying the triangle inequality on the LHS and observing that the RHS is a
  telescoping sum, we have
  \[d(a_m, a_n) \leq \sum_{i=m}^n d(a_i, a_{i+1}) \leq r_m - r_n \leq \varepsilon\]
  and so \((a_n)\) is Cauchy and hence its limit point is a point in the
  intersection of the balls, which is therefore non-empty.
